# Access-Control

## Introduction
This is my first real world project and it is part of an assesment of mine. Its purpuse is to read a *card ID* using a card reader and depending on whether or not the card ID is present in a list of acceptable cards, a switch is turned on/off on a *UniPi Neuron S103* controller.

## Used technologies
The project is written entirely in the Python programming language using different modules such as `requests` and `serial`. The project follows an OOP structure.
